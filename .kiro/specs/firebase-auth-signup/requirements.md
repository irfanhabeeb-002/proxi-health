# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements Firebase Authentication signup functionality with automatic Firestore user document creation. When a user successfully signs up with email and password, the system will automatically create a corresponding user document in Firestore with their profile information including role selection (patient or doctor). The implementation ensures data integrity by preventing overwrites of existing user data and provides comprehensive error handling with user feedback.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a new user, I want to sign up with my email and password, so that I can create an account and access the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user enters a valid email and password THEN the system SHALL create a Firebase Authentication account
2. WHEN the signup form is submitted with invalid email format THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message
3. WHEN the signup form is submitted with a weak password THEN the system SHALL display password requirements
4. WHEN the signup process fails due to existing account THEN the system SHALL display "Account already exists" message
5. WHEN the signup is successful THEN the system SHALL display a success message to the user

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a new user, I want to select my role during signup (patient or doctor), so that the system can provide role-appropriate functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the signup form is displayed THEN the system SHALL show radio buttons for "patient" and "doctor" roles
2. WHEN no role is selected THEN the system SHALL prevent form submission and display a validation message
3. WHEN a role is selected THEN the system SHALL store this selection for the Firestore document creation
4. WHEN the form is submitted THEN the system SHALL include the selected role in the user document

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want user profile data automatically stored in Firestore after successful signup, so that user information is available for the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Firebase Authentication signup is successful THEN the system SHALL automatically create a Firestore document in the "users" collection
2. WHEN creating the Firestore document THEN the system SHALL use the user's UID as the document ID
3. WHEN creating the user document THEN the system SHALL store the email field with the user's email address
4. WHEN creating the user document THEN the system SHALL store the role field with the selected role value
5. WHEN creating the user document THEN the system SHALL store the createdAt field with a server timestamp
6. IF a user document already exists in Firestore THEN the system SHALL NOT overwrite the existing data
7. WHEN Firestore document creation fails THEN the system SHALL display an error message but keep the Firebase Authentication account

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clean error handling throughout the signup process, so that users receive clear feedback and the system remains stable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any step of the signup process fails THEN the system SHALL display a user-friendly error message
2. WHEN network connectivity issues occur THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate connectivity error message
3. WHEN Firebase services are unavailable THEN the system SHALL display a service unavailable message
4. WHEN unexpected errors occur THEN the system SHALL log the error details and display a generic error message
5. WHEN errors are displayed THEN the system SHALL allow the user to retry the signup process

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want immediate feedback during the signup process, so that I know the status of my account creation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the signup process begins THEN the system SHALL show a loading indicator
2. WHEN the signup is successful THEN the system SHALL display a success message with confirmation
3. WHEN the signup fails THEN the system SHALL display the specific error message
4. WHEN the signup is complete THEN the system SHALL hide the loading indicator
5. WHEN displaying messages THEN the system SHALL use appropriate visual styling (success in green, errors in red)

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to remove the separate test "addUser()" functionality, so that user creation is streamlined through the signup process only.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing the new signup flow THEN the system SHALL remove any existing separate "addUser()" test buttons
2. WHEN the signup process is complete THEN the system SHALL have only one path for creating user documents
3. WHEN reviewing the codebase THEN there SHALL be no redundant user creation methods or UI elements
